# Sub-Agent Development Ecosystem

> A comprehensive, workflow-stage based sub-agent system for Claude Code that provides specialized AI assistance throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a complete sub-agent ecosystem designed to enhance software development productivity through intelligent task delegation and specialized expertise. The system automatically routes work to the most appropriate specialist based on file patterns, workflow stage, and task requirements.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our sub-agent ecosystem follows a **workflow-stage based architecture** that mirrors the natural software development lifecycle:

```
üìã PLANNING ‚Üí üî® IMPLEMENTATION ‚Üí üß™ VALIDATION ‚Üí üöÄ DEPLOYMENT
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                ‚Üì              ‚Üì
   analyst       developers        validators      devops
```

## ü§ñ Available Agents

### üìã Planning Stage
- **`product-requirements-analyst`** (Purple) - Requirements analysis & system architecture

### üî® Implementation Stage  
- **`frontend-developer`** (Blue) - React/shadcn/ui/Tailwind v4 specialist
- **`backend-developer`** (Green) - Multi-language server-side development
- **`sre-devops-specialist`** (Orange) - Infrastructure & deployment automation

### üß™ Validation Stage
- **`qa-testing-specialist`** (Cyan) - Quality assurance & test automation  
- **`security-compliance-auditor`** (Red) - Security analysis & compliance
- **`pre-commit-reviewer`** (Yellow) - Fast code quality gate

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone or copy the .claude directory to your project
cp -r .claude /path/to/your/project/

# Ensure hook scripts are executable
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
```

### 2. Agent Usage
Agents work automatically through intelligent delegation, or you can invoke them explicitly:

```bash
# Automatic delegation (via hooks)
# Just edit files - appropriate agents are suggested automatically

# Explicit invocation
> Use the frontend-developer agent to create a responsive navigation component
> Have the security-compliance-auditor review this authentication code
> Ask the qa-testing-specialist to create E2E tests for the checkout flow
```

### 3. Configuration
Review and customize the agent configuration in:
- `.claude/AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md` - Complete agent documentation
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook configuration
- `.claude/agents/` - Individual agent configurations

## üìã Hook System

### Auto-Delegation Hook (PostToolUse)
Triggers after file modifications to suggest appropriate agents:
```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|Update",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": ".claude/hooks/auto-delegate-agent.sh",
          "async": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pre-Commit Validation (PreToolUse)  
Runs comprehensive validation before GitPlus ship operations:
```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "mcp__gitplus.*ship",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": ".claude/hooks/pre-ship-workflow.sh",
          "async": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Incident Response**: < 15 minutes response time for critical issues
- **Documentation**: 100% API documentation coverage

## üöÄ Deployment & Production

### GitPlus Integration
The system integrates seamlessly with GitPlus for automated deployments:
```bash
# Automatic deployment with validation
> Use GitPlus to ship these changes

# The system will automatically:
# 1. Run pre-commit validation
# 2. Execute security scanning  
# 3. Perform quality checks
# 4. Deploy to production
# 5. Monitor deployment health
```

### Automated Release Management
The project uses **100% automated releases** based on conventional commits:

```bash
# Proper development workflow
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
git commit -m "feat: add new agent capability"
git push origin feat/new-feature

# After PR review and merge to main:
# ‚Üí Automated release pipeline triggers
# ‚Üí Semantic version calculated from commits  
# ‚Üí Release created automatically
# ‚Üí No manual intervention required
```

**CRITICAL**: Never create manual releases using:
- `gh release create` (breaks automation)
- GitHub UI release creation (conflicts with semantic versioning)
- Manual git tags (disrupts conventional commit flow)

All releases must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and be created automatically by the CI/CD pipeline. See [Branch Protection Setup](./.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md) for configuration details.

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-time Monitoring**: System health and performance metrics
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting on quality and security issues
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails and debugging information
