# Claude Agents

## Setup
```
> Use agent-architect to set up agents for this project
```

## Update
```
> Use agent-architect to check for updates
> Use agent-architect to upgrade agents
```

## How It Works
1. **agent-architect** analyzes your project
2. Creates 2-4 specialized agents based on your tech stack
3. Agents help with specific tasks (frontend, backend, testing, etc.)

## Custom Agents
Create your own in `.claude/agents/` using the template.
